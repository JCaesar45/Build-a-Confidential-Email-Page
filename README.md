# Confidential Email Page

This project implements a simple "Confidential Email Page" with dynamic elements such as "CONFIDENTIAL" and "TOP SECRET" divs, as well as blurred text for enhanced security simulation. The page uses HTML and CSS to create a layout that meets specified user stories for styling and functionality.

## Features

- **Confidential and Top-Secret Labels**: Two div elements that are styled with rotating text and distinct background colors for visual emphasis.
- **Blurring Effect**: Key information within the email body is blurred using CSS `filter: blur()` for a simulated security feature.
- **Responsiveness**: The email container is styled with padding, margins, and borders to give a neat, well-structured look.

## User Stories

This project fulfills the following user stories:

1. The main element has an ID of `email`.
2. The `#email` element has padding of 50px, a top margin of 50px, a width of 500px, and a 2px border.
3. The total width of the `#email` element, including paddings and borders, is 500px.
4. Two div elements (`#confidential` and `#top-secret`) exist within the `#email` element.
5. The `#confidential` and `#top-secret` elements are displayed inline-block.
6. Both elements have padding, left margin, and borders.
7. The `#confidential` element contains the text "CONFIDENTIAL."
8. The `#top-secret` element contains the text "TOP SECRET."
9. Both elements are rotated using the CSS `transform` property.
10. The email body includes at least three paragraphs.
11. Three `span` elements with the class `blurred` are added to the paragraphs.
12. The `blurred` class applies a `filter: blur(3px)` to the elements.

## Code Breakdown

### HTML (`index.html`)

* The `main` element with the ID `email` contains all the content.
* Two `div` elements, `#confidential` and `#top-secret`, are included with unique text content and styled for visual impact.
* Three paragraphs each contain `span` elements with the `blurred` class, applying a blur effect.

### CSS (`styles.css`)

* The `#email` element is styled with padding, margin, width, and border. The `box-sizing: border-box` ensures that the padding and border are included in the total width.
* The `#confidential` and `#top-secret` elements are styled to appear inline-block with padding, margins, borders, and rotated via `transform: rotate(-15deg)`.
* The `.blurred` class applies a blur effect to text with a 3px blur using the `filter` property.

## Usage

To customize the page:

* Edit the `#confidential` and `#top-secret` divs to change the text content or styling.
* Modify the paragraphs and spans within the email body to simulate different confidential content or blur different parts of the text.
* Adjust the rotation and other CSS properties to change the visual design of the page.
